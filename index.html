        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Framework features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>dynamic creation of UI elements</li>
            <li>interaction with existing UI elements (set text, size, position etc)</li>
            <li>listening for UI events (button clicks, touch etc)</li>
            <li>retrieving a list of elements from layouts described as xml</li>
